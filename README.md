Examples of python code processing biomechanical data


Force_Plate_Data_CMJ_JumpHeight:
- Processing Force Plate Data: Calculating Jump Height from a Countermovement Jump (CMJ)
1. Calculate the jump height using the Impulse-Momentum Theorem for each trial. 
2. Average the 3 trials for each testing session. 
3. Plot the average jump heights for the 4 sessions.



Running_MoCap_Data: 
- Processing Biomechanical Data: Motion Analysis data - Running data with 40 strides
1. Calculate the average joint angles across strides for the hip, knee, and ankle during stance phase.
2. Plot the average joint angle time series data.  
3. Calculate the average vertical GRF (y-axis). 
4. Plot the vertical GRFs time series data.
